abstract: "When U.S. presidential candidates misrepresent the facts, their claims get discussed across media streams, creating a lasting public impression. We show this through a public performance: the 2020 presidential debates. For every five newspaper articles related to the presidential candidates, President Donald J. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr., there was one mention of a misinformation-related topic advanced during the debates. Personal attacks on Biden and election integrity were the most prevalent topics across social media, newspapers, and TV. These two topics also surfaced regularly in votersâ€™ recollections of the candidates, suggesting their impression lasted through the presidential election."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We analyze misinformation about the US 2020 presidential election. We release both data and code including interactive visualizations.
