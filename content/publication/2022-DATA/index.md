abstract: The \#MeToo movement is one of several calls for social change to gain traction on Twitter in the past decade. The movement went viral after prominent individuals shared their experiences, and much of its power continues to be derived from experience sharing. Because millions of \#MeToo tweets are published every year, it is important to accurately identify experience-related tweets. Therefore, we propose a new task and compare the effectiveness of classic machine learning models, ensemble models, and a neural network model that incorporates a pre-trained language model to reduce the impact of feature sparsity. We find that even with limited training data, the neural network model outperforms the classic and ensemble classifiers. Finally, we analyze the experience-related conversation in the first year of the English language \#MeToo movement and determine that experience tweets represent a sizable minority of the conversation and are less correlated to major events than may be expected.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose pre-trained language models for political Twitter data. We evaluate all models and report results. We release both data and pre-trained models.
